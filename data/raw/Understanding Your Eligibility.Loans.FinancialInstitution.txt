Housing Loan from Financial Institutions
ou may finance your flat purchase with a housing loan from a financial institution (FI) that is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

You can apply for an In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the participating FIs through the integrated loan application service on the HDB Flat Portal. After you have confirmed the flat to purchase, you can request your preferred FI to convert the IPA into a Letter of Offer (LO) on the HDB Flat Portal.

Find out the key considerations and important information below when taking a housing loan from an FI. You may also read our frequently asked questions on applying for a housing loan from FIs through our integrated loan application service.

Refinancing

You cannot refinance to an HDB housing loan.

1.	Discharge the outstanding housing loan with the FI.
2.	Refund the CPF monies (with interest) that was used to finance the property.
3.	Pay the interest on the housing loan (from the date of default in payment, if applicable), and the interest on the CPF monies that was used.

The "Convert IPA to LO" e-Service for resale flat buyers who have received an outcome for their Request for Value^.
^ Do note that you must have a valid LO before you exercise the Option to Purchase to buy a resale flat. The FIs will liaise with you directly on accepting the housing loan offer. Please accept only 1 LO from an FI to finance your flat purchase.

The IPA and LO applications will be sent to the FI(s) of your choice. The FI(s) will inform you directly of the outcome of your application(s).

You may also approach other FIs, regulated by the MAS, on the Financial Institutions Directory to check your loan eligibility.

Do request a Customer Information Sheet from the FIs for your reference.

Must I take a housing loan from an FI?
You do not need a housing loan if you have sufficient cash and/ or CPF savings to pay for the flat purchase in full.

If you require a housing loan, you may take it from HDB or FI, subject to meeting the respective eligibility criteria and credit assessment guidelines.

HDB does not provide housing loans for the purchase of Executive Condominium units from property developers.
