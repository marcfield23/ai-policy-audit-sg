# Priority Schemes

Priority schemes enhance your chances in the computer ballot for flats offered in the Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises. You may apply for 1 priority scheme to enhance your chances in the ballot, if your household meet the eligibility conditions at the point of your HFE letter application.

However, if you qualify for the [Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=fpps), you may apply for 1 other priority scheme, such as the [Family Care Scheme (FCS) (Proximity)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=fcs-proximity) or [Third Child Priority Scheme (TCPS)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=tcps).

From the July 2025 sales exercise onwards, parents and their child(ren), married^ or single, enjoy priority access when they apply for a flat to live with or near each other under the FCS (Proximity). The other component of FCS, i.e., FCS (Joint Balloting), is planned for roll-out in the October 2025 sales exercise onwards. The current Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS) will then come under the FCS (Joint Balloting), for parents and child(ren), married or single, who wish to live near each other in the same BTO project. More details about the FCS (Joint Balloting) will be announced closer to its implementation.

^ Applicable to fiancé/ fiancée applicants

There is no priority or privilege to secure a small queue number to book a flat.

[**Priority for first-timers**\\
\\
As a first-timer applicant, you will enjoy greater priority and other privileges when you apply for a flat from HDB.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=mcps#Priorityforfirsttimers-1)

Among first-timer families, those with young children and young married couples buying their first home may qualify for priority as First-Timer (Parents & Married Couples), or FT(PMC). Read about the [FT(PMC) category](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=ftpmc) below to know more about the eligibility criteria and the additional support provided to help them settle down more quickly.

Couples comprising a first-timer and second-timer are treated as first-timer families and enjoy the same priority benefits and privileges.

## Privileges for first-timers

#### Higher proportion of flat supply

A higher proportion of flat supply is set aside for first-timer families. More information on the distribution of quotas can be found in [modes of sale](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/modes-of-sale).

#### Priority schemes

You may apply for 1 priority scheme to enhance your chances in the ballot, if your household meets the eligibility conditions. Read about the various priority schemes, such as [Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=fpps) and [Family Care Scheme (FCS) (Proximity)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=fcs-proximity), below.

#### Additional ballot chance

You will get 2 ballot chances as compared to second-timer applicants who will get 1 ballot chance. If you qualify for FT(PMC), you will get 3 ballot chances. However, in cases where there is an overwhelming demand for flats from first-timers, not all first-timers will be successful in the ballot.

All first-timers, including FT(PMC)s, will get 1 additional chance for every subsequent BTO application for a Standard flat, after they have been unsuccessful for 2 or more BTO applications (as a first-timer family) for Standard flats.

| **No. of Previous Unsuccessful BTO Applications for Standard Flats** | **Typical Chances** | **Additional Chances**<br>(+1 for every BTO application for Standard flats after 2 unsuccessful BTO applications for Standard flats) | **Total Chances** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FT(PMC)** | **Non-FT(PMC)** | **FT(PMC)** | **Non-FT(PMC)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(a)** | **(b)** | **(c)** | **(a) + (c)** | **(b) + (c)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 or 1 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 4 |
| 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 4 |

Note: The number of ballot chances will be capped at 5 for FT(PMC)s and 4 for non-FT(PMC) first-timer families.

An application is unsuccessful if you are not invited to book a flat (you did not receive a queue number), or the flats have all been booked before your queue number is due to book a flat.

Additional chances are not given for applications for Plus and Prime BTO flats and SBF exercises as the flat supply is limited.

## Application restrictions for rejecting a BTO/ SBF flat

If you had been invited to book a flat, but did not do so even though there were units available, you have rejected a chance to book a flat and incurred a non-selection count.

Nevertheless, there may be situations when flat applicants are left with limited choices when they are due to book a flat. HDB will waive the non-selection count for applicants with 10 or fewer BTO flats to choose from; or 5 or fewer SBF flats to choose from.

With 1 non-selection count, you will be deemed a second-timer for a year in the computer ballot and all your other flat applications will automatically be cancelled. Any additional ballot chances accumulated from your previous unsuccessful BTO applications for Standard flats will also be set to 0.

We strongly encourage applicants to consider carefully before they apply for a flat, and book a flat when they have a chance to do so.

[**First-Timer (Parents & Married Couples), or FT(PMC) category**\\
\\
To help young families settle down more quickly, additional support will be provided for applicants who qualify for the FT(PMC) category. \\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=mcps#FirstTimerParentsMarriedCouplesorFTPMCcategory-2)

First-timer families who meet all the following eligibility criteria may qualify for the FT(PMC) category:

- Families with at least 1 Singapore Citizen child aged 18 and below, or married couples aged 40 and below. This includes married couples who are expecting and have a doctor’s certification of the pregnancy
- Never owned or sold a residential property before, including an HDB flat
- Did not have a chance to book a BTO/ SBF flat in the past 5 years prior to their flat application

You do not need to request for the FT(PMC) category. HDB will assess and inform you about your eligibility after you have submitted your flat application.

## Additional support for FT(PMC) applicants

#### Additional ballot chance

You will receive 1 additional ballot chance^ when applying for the BTO/SBF exercises, on top of the 2 ballot chances that you will receive as a First-Timer family. This means that you will receive a total of 3 ballot chances when you apply for any flat type in any estate.

^ Capped at a total of 5 ballot chances.

#### First priority under the Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS)

If you apply for a 4-room or smaller BTO flat in Standard projects, you will be given first priority for the flats set aside under the [Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=fpps).

[**Family and Parenthood Priority Scheme (FPPS)**\\
\\
This scheme helps first-timer married couples with child(ren) and young married couples to get their flat more easily.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=mcps#FamilyandParenthoodPrioritySchemeFPPS-3)

## Flat allocation

Up to 40% of the public flat supply for BTO flats and up to 60% of the public flat supply for SBF flats are set aside for the applicants.

## Eligibility conditions

- You and your spouse must be first-timer buyers
- You have a Singapore Citizen child (i.e. natural offspring from a legal marriage or legally adopted) who is aged 18 or below. For adoptive parents, you must have the Adoption Order of your child when you apply for a flat
- If you or your spouse is expecting, and have a doctor's certification of the pregnancy, you may also apply for the FPPS

If you qualify for the FT(PMC) category, you will be eligible for the FPPS.

## Balloting process if you are eligible for FPPS and also applied for another priority scheme, e.g. TCPS

A computerised ballot is conducted for each priority scheme. For example, for a first-timer family with 3 children and is eligible for both the TCPS and FPPS, their application will first be balloted under the TCPS. If that ballot is unsuccessful, their application is balloted again under the FPPS.

[**Family Care Scheme (FCS) (Proximity)**\\
\\
This scheme helps parents and their child(ren), married or single, to live with or near each other for mutual care and support.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=mcps#FamilyCareSchemeFCSProximity-4)

From the July 2025 sales exercise onwards, parents and their child(ren), married\[1\] or single, enjoy priority access when they apply for a flat to live with or near each other under the FCS (Proximity). The priority access under the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) and the Senior Priority Scheme (SPS) (living with or near parents/ married child) will be retained under FCS (Proximity), which replaces these schemes.
