If the changes render you ineligible to continue with the flat purchase, your flat application will be cancelled.

OCS is offered to buyers of new flats offered in a Build-To-Order exercise for added convenience. You may opt in for OCS items during the flat booking appointment. The cost of the optional components will be added to the flat price.

Do note that if you do not opt for the OCS items during the flat booking appointment, you will not be able to do so later. This is because the building contractor of the project would have already ordered the required quantities and may have even completed the installations of the OCS items for the other flats.
