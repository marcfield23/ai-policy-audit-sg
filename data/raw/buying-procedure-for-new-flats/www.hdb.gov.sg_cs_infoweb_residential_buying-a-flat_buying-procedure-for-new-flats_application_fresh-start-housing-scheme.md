# Fresh Start Housing Scheme (Fresh Start)

Fresh Start helps ComLink+ families, meaning those with young children living in public rental flats, to own their next homes. By integrating financial assistance with personal responsibility and social support, the scheme helps families buy a 2-room Flexi or 3-room Standard flat on a shorter lease.

Interested households need to apply for Fresh Start before they can apply for a flat.

## Key features

Households under the Fresh Start Housing Scheme will be assisted in the following ways:

| **Types of flats and lease options** | - 2-room Flexi or 3-room Standard flat on a shorter lease, which will be more affordable than on a 99-year lease<br>- Lease options range from 45 years to 65 years, and must cover owners and their spouses till they are 95 years old |
