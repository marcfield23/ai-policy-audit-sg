# Frequently Asked Questions on Sales Exercise

Read on to find out the answers to some commonly asked questions by flat applicants when they apply for a flat in our public sales exercises.

The next BTO exercise will be held in October 2025. We encourage all flat buyers to apply for an [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) early and submit all required documents by 15 September 2025 if they are interested to participate in the October 2025 BTO exercise.

Visit the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing) for information on our upcoming sales exercises and [subscribe to HDB eAlerts](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF08CESS/Index.jsp) to receive notifications about them.

[**Q2: What are Standard, Plus, and Prime HDB Flats?** \\

From October 2024 onwards, new BTO projects will be classified as Standard, Plus, or Prime based on their locational attributes:

1. **Standard** flats will come with significant market discounts that are applied to all BTO flats. They will continue to form the largest category of BTO flats to be launched every year.
2. **Plus** flats will be in choicer locations across Singapore (e.g. good connectivity, proximity to amenities, and the city centre. Some may come with unique features, such as waterfront living).
3. **Prime** flats are in the choicest locations (e.g. centrally located, well-served by comprehensive amenities and have excellent transport connectivity).

Plus and Prime flats would naturally command higher market values given their attractive location and attributes. As such, these flats will be priced with additional subsidies to keep them affordable. They will also come with tighter resale and rental conditions, to ensure that buyers purchase such flats primarily for owner occupation.

The HFE letter will provide you with a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Second-timers will also be informed on the [resale levy/ premium](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=resale-levy) payable for the purchase of another subsidised flat from HDB.

You may read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/hdb-flat-portal/HFE/get-help) on the HFE letter.

The changes you can make depends on the stage of your flat application:

| **Household particulars or financial circumstances** | All details of the household in the flat application must be the same as the approved HFE letter.<br>For any changes in household particulars or financial circumstances, such as income, you must cancel both your HFE letter and flat application, and re-start Step 1 of the HFE letter application i.e. the Preliminary HFE check.<br>As an HFE letter application takes about a month to process after HDB receives all the required documents, you would not be able to apply for a flat in the ongoing sales launch. | Please contact us via [MyRequest@HDB](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BE15AWMyRequest/BE15PMain). If the changes render you ineligible to continue with the flat purchase, your flat application will be cancelled. The [usual financial forfeitures and consequences for the cancellation](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application?anchor=cancellation) will apply, depending on the stage of the application at the time of the cancellation. |
