## Milestones

#### Check eligibility and plan your finances

You must have a valid [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) before you may apply for a flat in our sales exercises. The HFE letter will provide you with a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to purchase a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/hdb-flat-portal/HFE/get-help) on the HFE letter.

You may request for an In-Principle Approval from the participating financial institutions when you apply for an HFE letter on the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing).
