Residential


# Modes of Sale

Our modes of sale are:

- Build-To-Order (BTO) exercise
- Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise
- Open booking of flats

Visit [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing) for information on BTO projects to be offered in the current and upcoming sales exercise, such as flat types, number of units and town map. Prices and additional details will be posted during the sales exercise. To be notified of the sales exercises, please [subscribe to HDB eAlerts](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF08CESS/Index.jsp). You may also read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/modes-of-sale/faqs-for-sales-launch) on sales exercise.

Applicants may be eligible for the various [priority schemes](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes) to increase their chances of getting a flat. Nevertheless, to discourage non-selection of flats and prioritise applicants who are in urgent need to buy a flat, [application restrictions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application?anchor=cancellation) will apply if you choose not to book a BTO or SBF flat when you are invited to do so.

Additionally, BTO/ SBF applicants who have received a queue position that is within the flat supply will not be eligible to apply for a flat in subsequent sales exercises until after their flat booking appointment. This is to give other applicants a chance to secure a flat.

An application is unsuccessful if you did not receive a queue number to book a flat, or the flats have all been booked before your queue number is due.

[**Build-To-Order (BTO)**\\
\\
The BTO system offers you flexibility in location and timing of your flat purchase. A BTO exercise offers a range of flat types across a few towns.\\

## How the BTO process works

The [flat types](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat/types-of-flats) offered are Community Care Apartments, 2-room Flexi, 3-, 4-, 5-room and 3Gen flats. You may apply for your preferred flat type and town, and a computer balloting will be conducted to determine whether your flat application is successful.

First-timer families enjoy higher priority for BTO flats. Couples comprising a first-timer and second-timer are treated as first-timer families with the same [priority benefits and privileges](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=privileges).

Here is an overview of the BTO process:

## Distribution of flat supply

More flats are allocated to first-timer families as they have a more pressing need for a home.

For seniors, at least 40% (minimum of 100 units per project) of the public flat supply of 2-room Flexi flats across Standard, Plus and Prime projects are set aside for them. Within this, half in Standard and Plus projects, and a quarter in Prime projects, are set aside for eligible seniors applying under the Senior Priority Scheme (SPS) (near existing home\[1\]) or Family Care Scheme (FCS) (Proximity). Any unused seniors’ quota will be distributed among the other non-senior households.

\[1\] For seniors applying a 2-room Flexi flat that is within 4 km of their owner-occupied property (either HDB flat or private residential property).

For second-timer families, up to 20% of the public flat supply will be set aside for them. If there are more second-timer families than the flat supply set aside for them, not all of them will be successful in their flat application.
