When you sign the Agreement for Lease, you will also need to pay stamp duty on the Agreement for Lease and the legal fee(s).\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-lease?anchor=downpayment#Stampdutyandlegalfees-3)

## Overview

| Type of Fee | HDB's Role |
| --- | --- |
| HDB acts for you in the purchase and mortgage\* | HDB acts for you in the purchase only | HDB acts for you in the mortgage\* only | HDB is not acting for you |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stamp duty on Agreement for Lease | Y | Y | N | N |
| Legal fee for purchase of flat from HDB <br>(subject to GST) | Y | Y | Y | Y |

\\* Applicable if you are taking a housing loan from HDB

## Calculation of stamp duty for Agreement for Lease

Stamp duty is based on the selling price of the flat. The amount payable is calculated as such:

- First $180,000: 1%
- Next $180,000: 2%
- Next $640,000: 3%
- Remaining amount: 4%

You may also use Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)'s [Stamp Duty Calculator](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=MSDCalculatorIntro) to compute the stamp duty payable for your flat purchase.

If applicable, you must also pay an annual stamp duty on your service and conservancy charges (S&CC) for the year. This is 0.40% of 4 times the S&CC amount for the year. This annual stamp duty is applicable if S&CC for the year plus annual rent of $1 is an amount exceeding $1,000.

## Calculation of legal fee

The fees that you may need to pay are:

- Legal fee for purchase of flat from HDB based on the purchase price of the flat
- Legal fee for HDB to act for you in the mortgage based on the housing loan amount taken for the flat

Legal fees are calculated as such:

- First $30,000: $0.90 per $1,000
- Next $30,000: $0.72 per $1,000
- Remaining Amount: $0.60 per $1,000

Please note that the legal fee is rounded up to the next dollar, before applying GST. The minimum legal fee chargeable is $21.80 (inclusive of GST).

## Sample calculation

The following is an example of the amount payable for a 4-room flat when signing the Agreement for Lease if you take an HDB housing loan and engage HDB to act for you in the purchase of your flat.

- Purchase price of flat: $345,000

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Downpayment based on 10% of the purchase price** | $34,500 |
| **Add:** |
| Stamp duty on Agreement for Lease | $5,100 |
| Legal fee for purchase of flat (inclusive of GST) | $239.80 |
| Total downpayment and fees | $39,839.80 |
| **Less:** |
| Option fee paid during booking of flat | $2,000 |
| **Total downpayment and fees payable (inclusive of GST, where applicable)** | $37,839.80 |

[**Staggered Downpayment Scheme**\\
\\
The Staggered Downpayment Scheme helps you to pay your downpayment in 2 instalments. Part of the downpayment is paid when you sign the Agreement for Lease. The remaining amount is paid during the collection of keys to your flat.\\

\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-lease?anchor=downpayment#DeferredDownpaymentSchemeDDS-5)

DDS will help to ease the cash flow of senior flat owners whose funds are tied up in their existing flat and smoothen their right-sizing process. It will automatically be extended to flat buyers who fulfil the following eligibility conditions:

- 55 years old and above at the time of their HFE letter application
- Have not sold or completed the sale of their existing flat at the time of their HFE letter application
- Have booked an uncompleted 3-room or smaller flat in any HDB sales exercises

With DDS, eligible flat buyers will only need to pay the stamp duty and legal fees when they sign the Agreement for Lease, within 9 months after booking a flat. They will pay the purchase price of the flat once it is ready for key collection. If the new flat application is cancelled, the usual forfeiture of 5% of the flat price will apply.

You will be informed during your flat booking appointment if you are eligible to defer your downpayment.

[**Power of Attorney (POA)**\\
\\
You will need a POA if you are unable to sign the Agreement for Lease or collect the keys personally. \\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-lease?anchor=downpayment#PowerofAttorneyPOA-6)

A Power of Attorney (POA) is a legal document that allows a person ('donor') to appoint another person ('attorney') to act on his behalf and in his name on matters specified in the POA.

As a flat buyer, you have to attend these appointments personally:

- Booking of flat
- Signing of Agreement for Lease
- Collection of keys

If you are unable to attend the booking appointment, you will have to complete the authorisation form given in the invitation package and have your representative submit it to us during your flat booking appointment.

If you are unable to attend the appointment to sign the Agreement for Lease and/ or collect the keys, you will have to approach a solicitor to prepare a POA to act on your behalf in the flat purchase.

All persons listed in the flat application must physically reside in the flat within 6 months after key collection and any period of non-occupation during the 6 months will be excluded from the MOP computation.

#### Steps required by you and your private solicitor

| Steps | Process |
| --- | --- |
| Step 1: Preparing the POA | Engage a solicitor to prepare the POA. |
| Step 2: Signing the POA | The POA has to be signed by you in the presence of your solicitor. If you are already overseas, you must sign the POA in the presence of one of the following parties:<br>- Notary Public\*<br>- Diplomatic or consular official from a Singapore Overseas Mission. Please visit the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Overseas-Missions/Find-A-Singapore-Overseas-Mission) to find the nearest Singapore Overseas Mission<br>\\* If you are using CPF OA savings to buy a flat, the POA must be witnessed and sealed/ stamped by an official from a Singapore Overseas Mission instead. You may visit the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs' website](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Overseas-Missions/Find-A-Singapore-Overseas-Mission) for more details on the nearest Singapore Overseas Mission. |
| Step 3: Registering the POA | After your POA has been signed, your solicitor will register the POA with the High Court Registry. |
| Step 4: Submitting required documents to HDB | Once the POA has been registered, you have to submit the following documents to us, at least 2 weeks before the scheduled appointment:<br>- Original POA + 1 photocopy<br>- Certified true copy from the High Court + 1 photocopy<br>- 2 certified true copies of the POA by an Advocate and Solicitor<br>- A letter from the solicitor confirming that the standard format for POA provided by HDB has been used<br>- Certified true copy by an Advocate and Solicitor together with the computer printout with the High Court seal. This is required in cases where POA has been registered through the Electronic Filing System |

#### Important note:

- If you are going overseas, you are advised to obtain the POA before leaving the country
- The POA cannot be used for the signing of the following documents, which you must sign personally:
  - Application form
  - Statutory declarations (you must sign in the presence of a Commissioner of Oaths or Notary Public)
  - Any undertakings
  - Loan agreement
- If you have submitted an original POA or a certified true copy of the POA from the High Court to us, it will be returned to your solicitor. This is after the Lease & Mortgage document has been registered with the Singapore Land Authority
