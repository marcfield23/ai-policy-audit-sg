Residential


# Application

We will announce the following details of the flats offered for sale in the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing):

- Location
- Indicative prices
- Preliminary designs
- The number of units of flats offered

If you wish to be notified of the sales exercises, please [subscribe to HDB eAlerts](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF08CESS/Index.jsp).

You must have a valid [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) before you may apply for a flat in our sales exercises. The HFE letter will provide you with a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to buy a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for. Read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/hdb-flat-portal/HFE/get-help)Â on the HFE letter.

You may read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/modes-of-sale/faqs-for-sales-launch) on sales exercises. After a sales exercise is announced, you can apply for a flat online at the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing) during the application period. An non-refundable administrative fee of $10 (inclusive of GST) per application is payable by credit card (MasterCard/ Visa) or scanning the QR code using any of the supporting mobile payment apps.

At the end of the application period, HDB will place all eligible applications through a computerised ballot to determine the queue order to book the flats. For first-timer families, as their flat allocation quota is at least a specified percentage, they can receive queue numbers bigger than the flat supply set aside for them. HDB will inform all applicants of the outcome of their application. You may check the [status of your application](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application?anchor=application-status) when the ballot result is announced.

[**Priority schemes**\\

If the changes render you ineligible to continue with the flat purchase, your flat application will be cancelled.

If your queue position is within the flat supply, you will not be eligible to apply for a flat in the subsequent BTO/ SBF exercises until after your flat booking appointment.
