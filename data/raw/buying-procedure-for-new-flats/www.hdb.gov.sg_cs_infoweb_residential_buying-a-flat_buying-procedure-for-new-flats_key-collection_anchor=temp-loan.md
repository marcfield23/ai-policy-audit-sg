# Key Collection

You will be invited to collect the keys to your booked flat when the keys are ready for collection. If you have booked a completed flat, you will sign the Agreement for Lease and collect the keys to the flat within 9 months after booking the flat.

You can view information such as the Probable Completion Date (PCD) and pictorial updates of the project via [My HDBPage](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/FI10PPORTAL/FI10PAtAGlance.jsp).

The PCD is the estimated completion date of your flat. The actual completion date may vary depending on the construction progress.

Individual blocks within the same project are progressively completed to facilitate key collection for all residents. While some blocks may look ready externally, there may still be works in progress, such as installation of doors and sanitary fittings, electrical installations and cleaning works.

We will invite you to collect the keys of your flat as soon as they are available.

The HPS is a mortgage-reducing insurance scheme offered by the CPF Board. \\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/key-collection?anchor=temp-loan#HomeProtectionSchemeHPS-8)

HPS is compulsory if you use CPF savings to pay the housing loan instalments.

In the event of death, terminal illness, or total permanent disability before the insured person turns 65, the HPS will settle the outstanding housing loan up to the sum insured, based on the share of cover applied.

The premium is paid annually using your CPF OA savings or cash. The premium amount depends on factors such as the declared percentage of coverage, loan amount, age, and sex of the insured person.

Visit the [CPF Board](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/home-ownership/protecting-against-losing-your-home) website for more information on HPS. The CPF Board website also has a [Home Protection Scheme Premium Calculator](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tools-and-services/calculators/home-protection-scheme-premium-calculator), which you may use to estimate the HPS premium amount.

[**Fire insurance**\\
\\
If you are taking a housing loan from HDB, you must buy a fire insurance policy from HDB's appointed insurer.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/key-collection?anchor=temp-loan#Fireinsurance-9)

The [HDB fire insurance](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/fire-insurance) is compulsory if you are taking a housing loan from HDB. It covers building structures, fixtures, and fittings provided by HDB. It does not include home contents such as furniture, renovations, and personal belongings.

On the day of your appointment to collect your new flat keys, you must produce a digital or hard copy of a valid Certificate of HDB Fire Insurance on the flat issued by our appointed insurer, Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd (Etiqa). For more details about the HDB fire insurance, you may call Etiqa’s enquiry line at 6887-8777, or visit [Etiqa’s website](http://www.etiqa.com.sg/fire-insurance).

You are encouraged to buy additional home contents insurance from any insurer if you wish to extend protection over your home contents that are not covered under the HDB fire insurance.

For those who are not taking a housing loan, you are also encouraged to buy fire and home contents insurance for your flat. You may do so from any insurer.

[**Existing flat owners**\\
\\
You must dispose of your flat, by sale or transfer, within 6 months of key collection. If you need the proceeds from the sale of your flat to pay for your flat purchase, do plan the sale to ensure that you have sufficient funds by your key collection appointment. \\

\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/key-collection?anchor=temp-loan#Afterkeycollection-13)

After key collection, you will become the flat owner and are liable for the conditions of ownership and payments, such as the housing loan instalments, monthly service and conservancy charges, or annual property tax.

Refer to our [checklist](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/moving-in/checklist) when you are ready to move in to your flat. Learn about [rectification works](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/moving-in/rectification-work-for-new-flats) for your flat and the [renovation guidelines](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/renovation).

Read the [conditions after buying](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying) to learn about the conditions that all flat owners and occupiers have to follow after moving into your flat, such as the [minimum occupation period](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=mop). Non-occupation of the flat is an infringement of the Housing & Development Act, for which HDB can compulsorily acquire the flat.
