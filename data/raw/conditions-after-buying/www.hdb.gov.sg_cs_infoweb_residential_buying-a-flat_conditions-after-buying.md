# Conditions After Buying

The conditions apply to both flat owners and occupiers.

## Core family nucleus

A householdâ€™s eligibility for housing subsidies and HDB housing loan is assessed based on the core family nucleus, which is formed by the core member(s). Core members refer to the applicant(s) and occupier(s) in an HFE letter application who enable the household to qualify for a flat purchase under an eligibility scheme. All core members must remain in the flat application, and physically reside in the flat during the [minimum occupation period (MOP)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=mop) after the flat purchase. Their names cannot be removed. They cannot apply or be listed in an HFE letter to buy an HDB flat or apply to buy an Executive Condominium unit from a property developer during the MOP.

The MOP is the period that you must physically reside in your flat.\\

Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying#MinimumoccupationperiodMOP-3)

All persons listed in an unclassified\[1\]/ Standard flat must physically reside in the flat for a minimum period of 5 years before they may do the following, subject to the respective prevailing eligibility conditions:

- Apply for an [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter)

- [Acquire interest in private property](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/acquiring-private-property), both local and overseas

The MOP starts from the legal completion date of your flat purchase and excludes any period where you do not physically reside in the flat, e.g. when the whole flat is rented out with HDB's prior approval or when there has been an infringement of the flat lease.

For new and resale [Plus and Prime](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat/standard-plus-and-prime-housing-models)\[2\] flats, the MOP is 10 years. For flats purchased under the [Fresh Start Housing Scheme](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/fresh-start-housing-scheme), the MOP is 20 years.

\[1\] Unclassified flats refer to flats sold before October 2024 sales exercise and not classified as Standard, Plus or Prime.

\[2\] Prime flats include Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flats sold before October 2024 sales exercise.

[**Resale levy**\\
\\
The resale levy is meant to reduce the housing subsidy of a second subsidised flat. It ensures a fairer allocation of housing subsidies among flat buyers.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying#Resalelevy-4)

If you have bought a subsidised housing, you must pay a resale levy when you are listed as a core applicant or core occupier in a flat application to buy a second subsidised flat. A subsidised housing is:

- A flat bought from HDB
- A resale flat bought with CPF housing grant(s)
- A Design Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat bought from a property developer with CPF housing grant
- An Executive Condominium (EC) unit bought from a property developer
- Other forms of housing subsidy, e.g. enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), privatisation of HUDC estate etc.

If you do not intend to buy a second subsidised flat from HDB, i.e., you are buying a resale flat or private residential property, you need not pay the resale levy.

## Payment of resale levy

The resale levy payable is determined at the point you book your second subsidised flat. It applies regardless of ownership type (joint-tenancy or tenancy-in-common) or shared interest in the flat. Payment must be made using cash and/ or your flat sale proceeds, and not a housing loan.

#### When and how payment is made

| Flat Sale Timeline | Resale Levy Payment |
| --- | --- |
| First subsidised flat was disposed of after key collection to the second subsidised flat | Resale levy deducted from the net proceeds upon the sale of the first subsidised flat<br>Any shortfall must be paid in cash |
| First subsidised flat was disposed of before key collection to the second subsidised flat | Resale levy must be paid in cash upon key collection to the second subsidised flat |

#### Subsidised flat sold on or after 3 March 2006

If you have sold your first subsidised flat from 3 March 2006 onwards, you will pay a fixed amount resale levy as follows:

| First Subsidised Housing Type | Resale Levy Amount |

| 2-room/ 2-room Flexi flat | $15,000 | $7,500 |
| 3-room flat | $30,000 | $15,000 |
| 4-room flat | $40,000 | $20,000 |

| 3Gen flat | $45,000 | Not applicable |
| Executive flat | $50,000 | $25,000 |
| Executive Condominium | $55,000 | Not applicable |

#### Subsidised flat sold before 3 March 2006

If the first subsidised flat was sold before 3 March 2006, a percentage graded resale levy will apply (see table for more details). It is subject to a minimum amount of $15,000 for 2-room, $30,000 for 3-room, $40,000 for 4-room, $45,000 for 5-room, and $50,000 for Executive flat sold.

| First Subsidised Housing Type | **Resale Levy Amount**<br>(Based on the higher of resale price of the sold flat, or 90% of its market value) |
| --- | --- |
| Households | Recipient of CPF Housing Grant (Singles) |
| --- | --- |
| 2-room flat | 10%\* or 15% | 5%\* or 7.50% |
| 3-room flat | 20% | 10% |
| 4-room flat | 22.50% | 11.25% |
| 5-room and Executive flat | 25% | 12.50% |

\\* Only applicable to 2-room flat sellers who buy a larger flat type.

[**Subsidy recovery**\\

\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying#Subsidyrecovery-5)

Due to their location and attributes, Plus and Prime flats come with additional subsidies to keep them affordable for a wider range of Singaporeans.

The subsidy recovery percentage is commensurate with the extent of the additional subsidy provided. It is fixed and will be provided when Plus or Prime projects are launched for sale. The subsidy recovery is in addition to any resale levy which may be payable when buying a second subsidised flat.

Subsidy recovery is not applicable to 2-room Flexi flats sold on short leases, Community Care Apartments, and resale Plus or Prime flats.

[**Renting out of whole flat or room(s)**\\
