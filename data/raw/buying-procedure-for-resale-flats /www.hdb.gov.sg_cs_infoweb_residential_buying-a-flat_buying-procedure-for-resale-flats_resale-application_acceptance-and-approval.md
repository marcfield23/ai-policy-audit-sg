# Acceptance and Approval

After HDB receives the complete resale application and supporting documents from you and the sellers, we will verify both parties’ eligibility and review the documents. If the application and documents are in order, we will notify you and the sellers of HDB’s acceptance of the application via SMS or email.

[**Acknowledge and endorse resale documents**\\
\\
You and the sellers must endorse the documents before HDB may approve the resale application.\\

We will prepare the necessary documents for you and the sellers to endorse, which will be ready about 3 weeks after the application have been accepted.

Once the documents are ready, they will be posted on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard), and we will notify you and the sellers via SMS to log in to My Flat Dashboard to endorse the documents.

If you or the sellers do not endorse the documents within the given timeframe, the resale application may be cancelled.

If you appoint HDB as the solicitors for the purchase of the flat, the documents to endorse include:

|     |     |

The balance purchase price must be paid on or before your [resale completion](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-completion) appointment.

For those who are taking a housing loan from an FI, the private solicitors acting in the purchase will arrange for you to make the initial payment.
