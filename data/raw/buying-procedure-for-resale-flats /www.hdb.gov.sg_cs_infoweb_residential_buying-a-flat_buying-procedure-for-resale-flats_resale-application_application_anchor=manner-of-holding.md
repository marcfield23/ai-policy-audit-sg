Thereafter, it will take about 8 weeks to process the application and complete the transaction. This is the earliest possible date to complete the transaction. If you wish to defer the completion, please discuss with your flat sellers and let us have a written confirmation (signed by both flat sellers and buyers) via [MyRequest@HDB](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BE15AWMyRequest/BE15PMain).

## Additional Information

[**Manner of holding**\\
\\
If there is more than one buyer in your resale application, you must state the manner of holding to determine the share of ownership of the flat.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application?anchor=manner-of-holding#Mannerofholding-1)

## Joint Tenancy

All the flat owners have an equal share on the flat regardless of how much each co-owner may have contributed to buy the flat.

The right of survivorship applies. This means that should any co-owner passes away, his/ her interest in the flat will be automatically passed on to the remaining co-owner(s). This is regardless of whether a will has been made by the deceased co-owner.

## Tenancy-in-common

Each co-owner holds a separate and definite share in the flat. Nevertheless, all the co-owners are entitled to use the whole flat, regardless of their share.

The right of survivorship does not apply. On the death of any co-owner, his/ her interest in the flat will be distributed according to his/ her will (if any). If there is no will, the interest in the flat will be distributed to his/ her beneficiaries in accordance with the Intestate Succession Act.

[**Ownership of property**\\
\\
You and all the people listed in the application must declare any interest in any private property when submitting the resale application.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application?anchor=manner-of-holding#Ownershipofproperty-2)

The declaration includes private residential, commercial (including market/ hawker stalls), and industrial properties, both in Singapore and overseas.

Read [Flat and Grant Eligibility](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility) to understand the eligibility conditions for buying a resale flat, including non-ownership of private residential property.

[**Power of Attorney**\\
\\
You will need a POA if you are unable to attend to certain matters of the buying process personally.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application?anchor=manner-of-holding#PowerofAttorney-3)

A Power of Attorney (POA) is a legal document that allows a person ('donor') to appoint another person ('attorney') to act on his behalf and in his name on matters specified in the POA.

As a flat buyer, you must sign documents personally, such as:

- Option to Purchase
- Application forms
- Declarations forms
- Legal documents

If you are unable to attend to these matters personally, you have to approach a solicitor to prepare a POA to act on your behalf in the flat purchase.

## What must you and your private solicitor do?

| Steps | Process |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 1: Preparing the POA** | Engage a solicitor to prepare the POA. |
| **Step 2: Signing the POA** | The POA has to be signed by you in the presence of your solicitor. If you are already overseas, you must sign the POA in the presence of one of the following parties:<br>- Notary Public\*<br>- Diplomatic or consular official from a Singapore Overseas Mission. Please visit the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)’ website](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Overseas-Missions/Find-A-Singapore-Overseas-Mission) to find the nearest Singapore Overseas Mission<br>\\* If you are using CPF Ordinary Account (OA) savings to buy a flat, the POA must be witnessed and sealed/ stamped by an official from a Singapore Overseas Mission instead. You may visit the [MFA's website](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Overseas-Missions/Find-A-Singapore-Overseas-Mission) for more details on the nearest Singapore Overseas Mission. |
| **Step 3: Registering the POA** | After your POA has been signed, your solicitor will register the POA with the High Court Registry. |
| **Step 4: Submitting required documents to HDB** | Once the POA has been registered, you have to state this in the application form and submit the following documents to us:<br>- Certified true copy from the High Court + 2 photocopies<br>- 2 certified true copies of the POA registered with the High Court by an Advocate and Solicitor<br>- A letter from the solicitor confirming that the standard format for POA provided by HDB has been used<br>- Certified true copy by an Advocate and Solicitor together with the computer printout with the High Court seal where POA has been registered through the Electronic Filing System |

##### Important points to note:

- If you are travelling overseas, you are advised to obtain the POA before leaving the country
- The POA cannot be used for the signing of the following documents, which you must sign personally:
  - Application form
  - Statutory declarations (you must sign in the presence of a Commissioner of Oaths or Notary Public)
  - Any undertakings
- If you have submitted an original POA or a certified true copy of the POA from the High Court to us, it will be returned to your solicitor. This is after the Lease & Mortgage document has been registered with the Singapore Land Authority
- However, certified true copies of the POA by your solicitors will be retained by HDB

[**Bankruptcy**\\
\\
You are required to indicate in your application form if you are an undischarged bankrupt.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application?anchor=manner-of-holding#Bankruptcy-4)

If you are an undischarged bankrupt, prior consent must be obtained from the Official Assignee (OA) or the private trustee, if:

- You are applying to buy an HDB flat that is bigger than a 5-room flat or a 3Gen flat
- You are buying any flat type with a net purchase price of $500,000 or above, after taking into account any HDB subsidies or levy

You do not need to seek consent from the OA or private trustee if you are listed as an occupier of a flat.
