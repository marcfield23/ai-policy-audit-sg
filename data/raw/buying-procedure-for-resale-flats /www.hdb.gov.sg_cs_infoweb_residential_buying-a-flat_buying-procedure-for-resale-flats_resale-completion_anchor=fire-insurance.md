We will notify you via SMS on the specific date and time of your resale completion once it is confirmed and post the information on [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard).

If you have appointed HDB as the solicitors for the purchase of the flat, you have to attend the appointment in person at the HDB Resale Office, HDB Hub.

If you have appointed private solicitors, your solicitors’ representative may attend the appointment on your behalf. You need to confirm with your solicitors on the arrangement.

#### Time of appointment

| Housing loan from HDB | Between 10am to 12pm |
| Housing loan from a financial institution | Between 2pm to 5pm |
| Not taking a housing loan | Between 10am to 12pm or 2pm to 5pm |

#### Change of appointment date

The resale completion appointment date stated in the application acceptance email is the earliest possible date to complete the transaction. HDB is unable to accede to any request to bring forward the completion date.

If you would like to defer the resale completion, please submit a written confirmation signed by both the buyers and sellers, agreeing to the new date, via [MyRequest@HDB](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BE15AWMyRequest/BE15PMain) within a week from the date of HDB’s acceptance letter.

#### If you are unable to attend the resale completion appointment

If you are unable to attend the resale completion appointment personally, e.g., you are overseas, you can prepare a [Power of Attorney](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-resale-flats/resale-application/application?anchor=poa) to appoint another person to act on your behalf and attend the resale completion. Certified true copies of the Power of Attorney have to be submitted to HDB at least 1 week before the appointment.

Before the resale completion appointment, you need to arrange with the sellers to inspect the flat and ensure that the sellers will be able to deliver vacant possession by the resale completion date.

[**Buy fire insurance**\\

If you are taking a housing loan from HDB, you must buy fire insurance policy from HDB's appointed insurer.\\

The [HDB fire insurance](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/fire-insurance) is compulsory if you are taking a housing loan from HDB. It covers building structures, fixtures, and fittings provided by HDB. It does not include home contents such as furniture, renovations, and personal belongings.

During your resale completion appointment, you must produce a digital or hard copy of a valid Certificate of HDB Fire Insurance on the flat issued by our appointed insurer, Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd (Etiqa). For more details about the HDB fire insurance, you may call Etiqa’s enquiry line at 6887-8777, or visit [Etiqa’s website](http://www.etiqa.com.sg/fire-insurance).

If the sellers have a valid HDB fire insurance for the flat, you need not buy another fire insurance. However, you will need to renew the fire insurance policy when the existing policy expires.

You are encouraged to buy additional home contents insurance from any insurer if you wish to extend protection over your home contents that are not covered under the HDB fire insurance.

For those who are not taking a housing loan, you are also encouraged to buy fire and home contents insurance for your flat. You may do so from any insurer.
