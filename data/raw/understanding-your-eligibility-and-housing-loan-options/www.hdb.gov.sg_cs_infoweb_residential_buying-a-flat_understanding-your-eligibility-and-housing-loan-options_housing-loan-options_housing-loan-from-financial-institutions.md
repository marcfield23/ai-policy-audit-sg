# Housing Loan from Financial Institutions

You may finance your flat purchase with a housing loan from a financial institution (FI) that is regulated by the [Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)](http://www.mas.gov.sg/).

You can apply for an In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the participating FIs through the [integrated loan application service](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-financial-institutions?anchor=integrated-loan-service) on the HDB Flat Portal. After you have confirmed the flat to purchase, you can request your preferred FI to convert the IPA into a Letter of Offer (LO) on the HDB Flat Portal.

Find out the key considerations and important information below when taking a housing loan from an FI. You may also read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/hdb-flat-portal/HFE/get-help/integrated-housing-loan-application-service) on applying for a housing loan from FIs through our integrated loan application service.

The purchase of an HDB flat may require the services of solicitors for the conveyancing and mortgage (if any).

If you are taking a housing loan from an FI, you need to appoint a private solicitor for the conveyancing and mortgage of the flat. Please submit a letter from your solicitor to HDB to confirm this at the following stage:

- Purchase of new flat: Before signing the Agreement for Lease; or
- Purchase of resale flat: At submission of resale application.
