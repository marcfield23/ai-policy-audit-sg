# Step-Up CPF Housing Grant (Families)

If you and your family are second-timer applicants, you may apply for the Step-Up CPF Housing Grant of $15,000 to help with your new or resale flat purchase.

If you are buying a resale flat, you may also apply for the [Proximity Housing Grant (Families)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/proximity-housing-grant-families) if you meet the eligibility conditions.

Apply for an [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) via the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing) for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to buy a new or resale flat, as well as the amount of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.
