# Application for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) Letter

![What is an HFE letter (Implementation) [8 May 2023]](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/-/media/HDBContent/Images/EAPG/EAPG-COS/What-is-an-HFE-letter-implementation.png?h=100%25&w=100%25&hash=CD5A54111592A109AEDB9D85518A7E40)

## Make an informed decision

Log in to the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing) using your Singpass to apply for an HFE letter. The HFE letter will provide you with a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options and help you plan your budget before you embark on your home buying journey. Second-timers will also be informed on the [resale levy/ premium](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=resale-levy) payable for the purchase of a subsidised flat from HDB. Read our [frequently asked questions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/hdb-flat-portal/HFE/get-help) on the HFE letter and [how to apply](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter?anchor=how-to-apply) for one.

## Integrated loan application service

You may request an In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the participating financial institutions (FIs) when you apply for an HFE letter. The IPA will provide you with the FI’s indicative loan amount. Your chosen FI(s) will reach out to you directly on the outcome(s) of your IPA application(s) and you will be able to confirm their loan offer(s) through the HDB Flat Portal after you have secured a flat purchase. The service is free of charge.

When you apply for an HFE letter, you will be guided to retrieve your information via Myinfo to minimise form-filling and reduce submission of documents. However, in some cases, supporting documents may still be required as Myinfo may not have all the required information or details. You will be informed via SMS and email if you need to submit documents.

Get a head start on your application by reading our [income guidelines](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter/income-guidelines).

[**Validity and possible review of HFE letter**\\
\\
Understand when and why your HFE letter may be reviewed.\\
\\

| **Validity of HFE letter** | The HFE letter is valid for 9 months from the date of issue.<br>If you have already submitted a flat application with your HFE letter, you may proceed with the flat purchase even if the HFE letter has since expired. |
| **Possible review of HFE letter** | The outcome of your HFE letter will be reviewed if:<br>- Any given information is untrue or incorrect<br>- You and any persons listed in the application do not comply with any terms and conditions to buy an HDB flat, apply for CPF housing grants and/ or take up an HDB housing loan<br>- There are any changes in your family members, or other circumstances such as changes in HDB’s policies and/ or processes which may affect your eligibility to buy an HDB flat, apply for CPF housing grants and/ or take up an HDB housing loan<br>If you book an uncompleted flat with HDB, we will review your financial position nearer the completion of the flat, to confirm that there are no adverse changes in your ability to service the HDB housing loan. Otherwise, the loan amount may be reduced. |
| **Use of HFE letter and changes in household details** | The applicant(s) and occupier(s) listed in your new or resale flat application must remain the same as those in your HFE letter application.

If there are changes to your household details, this may affect your eligibility to buy an HDB flat, obtain CPF housing grants and/ or take up an HDB housing loan and hence, invalidate your HFE letter. Accordingly, HDB reserves the right to cancel your new or resale flat application(s).

For new flat application, the usual [financial forfeitures and consequences](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application?anchor=cancellation) for the cancellation will apply, depending on the stage of the application at the time of the cancellation.

For resale flat application, you will remain liable to the flat seller under the Option to Purchase which you have exercised.

| **Stage of HFE Letter Application** | **Procedure** |
| --- | --- |
| **Pending approval** | [Cancel](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp27/HFEeService/cancel) your HFE letter. After cancellation, apply for a fresh HFE letter (i.e. complete Step 1 and Step 2 of the buying process again) by logging in to the [HDB Flat Portal](http://homes.hdb.gov.sg/). |

- Citizenship
- Ownership of private properties

| **Re-application of HFE letter** | If you have already submitted a flat application with your HFE letter, you do not need a fresh HFE letter to continue with the flat application.<br>If your HFE letter is expiring in the next 30 days and you need more time to submit a new or resale flat application, please apply for a fresh HFE letter. If there are no changes in the applicant(s) and occupier(s) listed other than their employment or income, please log in to the [HDB Flat Portal](http://homes.hdb.gov.sg/), select My Flat Dashboard > Applying an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter > Step 2 - Apply for HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) Letter > View/ Re-apply HFE Letter.<br>If you need to make other changes, you may refer to the [use of HFE letter and changes in household details](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter?anchor=household-details) for more information.<br>HDB will process your HFE letter application based on your latest situation and prevailing policies.
