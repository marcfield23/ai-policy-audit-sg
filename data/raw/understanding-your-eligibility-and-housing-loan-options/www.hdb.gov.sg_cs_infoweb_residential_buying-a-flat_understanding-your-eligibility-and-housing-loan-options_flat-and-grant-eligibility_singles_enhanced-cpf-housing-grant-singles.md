# Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (Singles)

If you are a first-timer applicant buying a flat on your own or with your non-resident spouse, you may be eligible for an Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) (Singles) to help with your new or resale flat purchase.

From 20 August 2024, first-timer singles may qualify for an EHG (Singles) of up to $60,000. If you are buying with other first-timer single(s), up to 2 singles may each be eligible for an EHG (Singles), i.e., a total of up to $120,000.

If you are buying a resale flat, you must first qualify for the [CPF Housing Grant for Resale Flats (Singles)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/singles/cpf-housing-grant-for-resale-flats-singles) before you may be eligible for the EHG. You may also apply for the [Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) (Singles)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/singles/proximity-housing-grant-singles) if you meet the eligibility conditions.

Apply for an [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) via the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing) for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to buy a new or resale flat, as well as the amount of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.

## Core family nucleus

A householdâ€™s eligibility for housing subsidies and HDB housing loan is assessed based on the core family nucleus, which is formed by the core member(s). Core members refer to the applicant(s) and occupier(s) in an HFE letter application who enable the household to qualify for a flat purchase under an eligibility scheme. All core members must remain in the flat application, and physically reside in the flat during the [minimum occupation period (MOP)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=mop) after the flat purchase.

| **Ownership/ interest in property in Singapore or overseas other than HDB flat** | #### Interest or ownership in a property

You are considered to own or have an interest in a property if you and/ or your spouse\[2\] have acquired a property through purchase or when it is:

- Acquired by gift
- Inherited as a beneficiary under a will or from the Intestate Succession Act
- Owned, acquired, or disposed of through nominees
- Acquired by holding on trust for another person/ entity
- Held on trust with you and/ or your spouse as the beneficiary

\[2\] Refers to both current and late spouse, if any.

The conditions on ownership/ interest in private residential and non-residential property apply to **all local and overseas properties that are completed or uncompleted**, and include but are not limited to the following:

| Private residential property | Non-residential property |
| --- | --- |
| A house, building, land that is under a residential land zoning (including land with multiple land zoning\[3\]), Executive Condominium (EC) unit, privatised HUDC flat and mixed use development\[4\].<br>\[3\] E.g. residential with commercial at 1st storey or commercial and residential zoning.<br>\[4\] E.g. properties with a residential component, such as HDB shop with living quarters or shophouse. | A property under a non-residential land zoning and/ or the permitted use does not include housing.<br>This may include commercial properties (e.g. shops or offices), industrial properties, market/ hawker stalls, or vacant/ plantation/ agricultural land. |

#### Private residential property

All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application:

- Must not own or have an interest in any local or overseas private residential property; and
- Must not have disposed of any private residential property in the last 30 months, from the legal completion date, before the HFE letter application.

For example, if the private residential property was disposed of on 1 July 2024, based on the legal completion date of disposal, you may apply for an HFE letter to buy a flat from HDB, resale Plus or Prime flat, or resale unclassified\[5\]/ Standard flat with CPF housing grant(s), or take an HDB housing loan on or after 1 January 2027.

\[5\] Unclassified resale flats refer to flats sold before October 2024 sales exercise and not classified as Standard, Plus or Prime.

#### Non-residential property

All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application can, as a household, own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property\[6\] at HFE letter application, if they wish to buy a flat from HDB, a resale Plus/ Prime\[7\] flat, or a resale unclassified/ Standard flat with CPF housing grant(s).

If applicants and occupiers own or have an interest in more than 1 non-residential property, they must dispose of the other non-residential properties at least 30 months (counted from the legal completion date of the disposal of the interest) before applying for an HFE letter.

\[6\] This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.

\[7\] Prime flats include Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flats sold before October 2024 sales exercise. The eligibility criteria for resale Prime flats follow the prevailing BTO eligibility criteria. |
| **Amount** | The amount is based on the average gross monthly income assessed over the months worked during the 12-month period, which ends 2 months preceding the month of HFE letter application.

| Household | Income assessment |
| --- | --- |
| On your own or with your parents | Your income only |
| With other first-timer single(s) | Income of all persons (all applicants and occupiers) |
| With your non-resident spouse | Half of the income of all working persons (all applicants and occupiers) |
