First-timers with non-resident family members may apply for [CPF Housing Grant for Resale Flats (Singles)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/singles/cpf-housing-grant-for-resale-flats-singles).

If you have previously taken the CPF Housing Grant (Singles) for a resale flat or bought a 2-room or 2-room Flexi flat from HDB as a single, and are now married, you may apply for the Top-Up Grant.

Apply for an [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) via the [HDB Flat Portal](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing) for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to buy a new or resale flat, as well as the amount of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.

## Core family nucleus

A household’s eligibility for housing subsidies and HDB housing loan is assessed based on the core family nucleus, which is formed by the core member(s). Core members refer to the applicant(s) and occupier(s) in an HFE letter application who enable the household to qualify for a flat purchase under an eligibility scheme. All core members must remain in the flat application, and physically reside in the flat during the [minimum occupation period (MOP)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=mop) after the flat purchase. Their names cannot be removed.
