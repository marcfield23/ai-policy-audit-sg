Please check the eligibility conditions for buying an EC unit. You have to engage a solicitor to act for you in the conveyancing matters. Do also arrange with a financial institution for a housing loan if you need one, and check with CPF Board on the use of your CPF Ordinary Account savings to pay for the EC unit.

## Sale of EC units on the open market

EC owners may put up their unit for sale on the open market once they have met the [minimum occupation period (MOP)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/executive-condominium/conditions-after-buying-for-ec) from the date of Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP).

If you are looking to buy an EC unit on the open market that have met the MOP, please check if you meet the following eligibility conditions. Please note that these are considered private properties and the resale transaction will be completed by your solicitors at their office.

Purchase of resale EC units is not eligible for any CPF housing grants. Second-timers are not required to pay a [resale levy](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/conditions-after-buying?anchor=resale-levy) when buying an EC unit that have met the MOP on the open market.
