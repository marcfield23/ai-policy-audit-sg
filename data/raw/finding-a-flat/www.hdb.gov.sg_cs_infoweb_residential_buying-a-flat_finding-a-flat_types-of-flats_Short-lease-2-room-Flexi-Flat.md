#### Return of short-lease 2-room Flexi flats

A short-lease 2-room Flexi flat cannot be sold in the open market. If you no longer wish to live in it or become ineligible to do so, the flat must be returned to HDB. We will then pay you the value of the unused portion of the lease when you return the short-lease 2-room Flexi flat.
