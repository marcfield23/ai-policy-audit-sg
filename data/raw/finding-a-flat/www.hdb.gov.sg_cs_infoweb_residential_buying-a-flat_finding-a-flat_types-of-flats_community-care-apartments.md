[**Priority for those with care needs**\\
\\
We recognise that seniors with care needs are more likely to require the support available in the Community Care Apartments.\\
\\
Arrow down icon](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat/types-of-flats/community-care-apartments#Priorityforthosewithcareneeds-5)

You will qualify for priority flat allocation if at least 1 applicant or essential occupier in your household requires permanent assistance with his/ her Activities of Daily Living (ADL).

This means always requiring some assistance with any of the activities below:

- Washing/ showering
- Going to the toilet
- Getting dressed
- Eating
- Walking/ moving around
- Transferring (e.g. moving from bed to a chair or wheelchair and vice versa)

Some units will be set aside for seniors who require priority, and details will be provided at the sales launch.

Seniors who need high medical and nursing care, or have been diagnosed with severe mental illness and/ or loss of mental capacity may not be suitable for the Community Care Apartments, as the available caregiving services are intended for residents with relatively lower care needs.

Please note that priority flat allocation for those with care needs is only applicable to new launches of Community Care Apartments in Build-To-Order (BTO) exercises. It is not available for Community Care Apartments offered as Sale of Balance Flats (SBF).
