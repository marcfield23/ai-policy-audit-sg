Standard, Plus, and Prime Housing Framework


# Standard, Plus, and Prime Housing Framework

The new location-based classification of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats will ensure our public housing system continues to meet Singaporeans’ housing needs and aspirations – home ownership, inclusive communities, fairness, and sustainability.

From October 2024 onwards, new BTO projects launched will be classified as Standard, Plus or Prime flats, to better reflect their locational attributes:

- **Standard** flats will come with significant market discounts that are applied to all BTO flats. They will continue to form the largest category of BTO flats to be launched every year.
- **Plus** flats will be in choicer locations across Singapore (e.g. good connectivity, proximity to amenities, and the city centre. Some may come with unique features, such as waterfront living).
- **Prime** flats are in the choicest locations (e.g. centrally located, well-served by comprehensive amenities and have excellent transport connectivity).

Due to their attractive locations and attributes, Plus and Prime flats would naturally command higher market values. They will be priced with additional subsidies to keep them affordable and enable Singaporeans over a wider range of income levels to buy them. They will also come with tighter resale and rental conditions, to ensure that buyers purchase such flats primarily for owner occupation.

The new classification will not apply to existing HDB flats and flats launched before the October 2024 BTO exercise.

## Key features of Standard, Plus, and Prime flats

The table below provides a comparison of the key features of Standard, Plus and Prime flats.

|  | Classification of flats |
| --- | --- |
| Standard | Plus | Prime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Subsidies** | Significant market discounts | More subsidies, in addition to significant market discounts | Most subsidies, in addition to significant market discounts |
| **Subsidy recovery upon resale of flat \[1\]** | No | Yes (less than Prime) | Yes |
| **Minimum occupation period (MOP)** | 5 years | 10 years | 10 years |
| **Resale of flat \[1\]** | Allowed after MOP, with tighter resale conditions for Plus and Prime flats |
| **Investment in private residential property** | Allowed after MOP |
| **Renting out of whole flat \[1\]** | Allowed after MOP | Not allowed | Not allowed |
| **Renting out of spare rooms** | Allowed for 3-room or bigger flats |

\[1\] 2-room Flexi flats sold on short-lease and Community Care Apartments cannot be rented out (bedroom or whole flat) or sold in the open market.

Upon selling or transfer of a Plus or Prime flat bought from HDB^, you will be required to return a percentage of the resale price\* of the flat to HDB. The subsidy recovery percentage is commensurate with the extent of the additional subsidy provided for the flat to ensure a fair system of subsidies for all buyers. The amount will be made known when Plus or Prime projects are launched for sale.

If you buy a resale Plus or Prime flat on the open market, the subsidy recovery does not apply when you sell the flat. However, other restrictions, such as the 10-year MOP, prohibition of whole flat rental, and eligibility of your flat buyers, will apply.

^ Not applicable to 2-room Flexi flats sold on short-lease and Community Care Apartments.

\\* Where HDB assesses that a flat valuation is required, the subsidy recovery will be a percentage of the valuation or the resale price of the flat (whichever is higher).

## More housing options for singles

Previously, singles were limited to applying for a new 2-room Flexi flat in non-mature estates or buy a resale flat (excluding 3Gen flats) in any estate on the open market.

Starting with the October 2024 BTO exercise, eligible singles will have more housing options to choose from. They can buy:

|  | Flat Type | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **New flats** | 2-room Flexi flat | Standard, Plus and Prime |
| **Resale flats** | 2-room flat | Prime |
| All flat types (excluding 3Gen flat) | Standard, Plus and existing flats that are not under the new classification |
