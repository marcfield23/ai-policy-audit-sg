# Finding a Flat

You may use the following resources to help you plan and prepare for your flat purchase.

Apply for an [HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter) via [My Flat Dashboard](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp28/TimeLine/my-flat-dashboard) for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. You can concurrently apply for an In-principle Approval letter for housing loan from one or more of our participating financial institutions.

The HFE letter will inform you upfront of your eligibility to buy a new or resale flat, as well as the amounts of CPF housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.

After obtaining an HFE letter, [find listings of both new and resale flats available for purchase](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/finding-a-flat) that meets your budget and needs.
